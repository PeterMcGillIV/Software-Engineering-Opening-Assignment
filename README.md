To run this code, retrieve the programming assignment folder from the repository as well as the Programming-Assignment-Data and Programming-Assignment-Output.
Before doing anything else, it is wise to get the path of the Data folder and the Output folder since they will be necessary to run the code later. To do this,
cd to the directory you put them in, and run this command "realpath (desired folder here)", and then copy and paste the file paths somewhere else for later.
Then cd your way into "Programming\ Assignment" and "src". Once you're in there, compile by typing "javac *.java" and once you've done that, type "java Main" to
run the program. It will prompt you for the path of the input folder. Paste the path for Programming-Assignment-Data and press enter, and then the program will
also ask you for the path of the output folder. For this one, you'll need to paste the path of Programming-Assignment-Output. If an xml file or a png file is
incorrectly written, you may see an error message for that pair only, but all the other file pairs will have their correctly annoted png files in the output folder.
